# WEATHER APP

## Introduction

Project with weather data, based on the openweathermap api's.

The point of this project was to learn how to work with API.

You can see: 
- current weather and temperature,
- some basic details like wind speed, pressure, humidity, visibility, min and max temp,
- todays weather for every three hours,
- time of sunrise and sunset and,
- 4 day weather in advance.

I used api to get coordinates from entering the city name, api to use that coordinates and get basic weather data and a 3 hour / 5 day api. 

The basic api for current weather holds data for about 200.000 cities.

I also added geo location api to read the users location and show the weather based on the lat and lon. 

I added weather icons based on day and night, and also based on the main weather. 

Made a basic design in figma, which wasn't much for this project to be honest. It is also responsive and looks even nicer on the phone. 

I enjoyed it very much and could make even more options with some better api's. 

I got a better design idea, but since i can't draw illustrations (yet, hopefully one day i will learn), i added gradient color that would match the existing weather.

## Source

This project is based on the odin project bootcamp, I followed the instructions, but the logic of the implementation and the design are both mine. https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-weather-app
